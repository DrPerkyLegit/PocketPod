# Pocket Pod

[![CC: Tweaked Version: 1.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/CC:%20tweaked-1.8+-green?style=flat-square&logo=GNOME%20Terminal)](https://tweaked.cc/)

Pocket Pod is a fork of musicify tested for CC:Tweaked 1.8+

## Webserver
Webserver was replaced with static github files cause replit doesnt really have a free method anymore

## Q&A
Why use github for songs? its simple to use and free, just upload file and push
Why pull songs from the internet? music files can be big, over 1MB and pocket computers only have 1MB of storage. Thats why i made this, to stream music.
Where do i convert my music? https://remote.craftos-pc.cc/music/
Despite my files being .wav there actually still dfpwm format, [DFPWM in WAV Format](https://gist.github.com/MCJack123/90c24b64c8e626c7f130b57e9800962c)
