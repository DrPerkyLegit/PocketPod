Pocket Pod is a fork of musicify designed to pull music from a replit webserver

## Webserver
My webserver is open source so have at it and host your own

## Q&A
Why use replit? its simple to use and free, you can use uptimerobot to keep your replit from sleeping also.
Whats the webserver for? DFPWM music can be big, over 1MB big and pocket computers have 1MB. Thats why i made this, to stream music.
Where do i convert my music? https://remote.craftos-pc.cc/music/
